Contact List

    Create a contact list. Add a button to create a new contact. Once the contact will be created it will redirect to a new page and show the list of contacts added.


    Each contact will be edited and deleted. Two fields will be there Contact Name and Mobile Number. Users can re-order the contacts and move the contact up and down.


    There will be a search filter to find the contacts and the contacts results will be shown according to the keywords.
